# apartment-Booking-SYSTEM-
Manage your apartment bookings efficiently with our PHP-based booking Management System. This system streamlines check-in, room bookings, and real-time room status updates, making it easy for customers and staff. It's user-friendly, expandable, and built on the robust XAMPP platform. Your guests deserve the best, our system helps you deliver it.

This project is an apartment booking system that automates the major operations such as generating COD, bills, and item details to the customer. It also provides services to customers like booking (advance/current), cancellation of advance booking, enquiring about any customer (by name/customerId) or about room availability. The project has scope in apartments since the routine activities of managing operations become easy.
